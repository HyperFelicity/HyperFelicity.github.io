            Hi, my name is Julian Mladen Islic. I have created this website because I believe a resume or cover letter is not enough to describe one person.
            This website was designed so that people such as potential employers, friends and co-workers can get acquainted with my skills. It also serves
            as a complete portfolio of my life which include work and volunteer experience, personal projects and any awards I may have won. <br><br>*Disclaimer: This 
            website is not tailored to a specific job or company as it is a complete summary of my skills and not a targeted form of self advertisement.*
