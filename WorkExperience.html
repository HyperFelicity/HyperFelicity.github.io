                    Besides the technical skills, this job required a lot of interpersonal skills.  I am constantly meeting and forming
                        relationships with new clients to discover which services they require and managed time appropriately to get work done
                        in a timely matter. I Developed strong organizational skills by creating personalized plans for clients to accommodate
                        for their computing needs as well as give purchasing advice based off of the clients workload.
